# NES Tetris Hacks

This was an attempt to build multiple modifications together.  It became a mess and now serves mainly as an AnyDAS Tournament ROM.  There are various goofy hacks either hidden behind build flags or buried in a branch.  Some hacks may be incompatible and not all hacks are complete.

The minimum requirements to build are python 3.8+ with the pillow module installed and the ca65 & ld65 binaries from cc65.  See [simple.sh](simple.sh).
