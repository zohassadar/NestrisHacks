## 30 wide with big pieces

this branch only works when built with these flags:

`bash build.sh -H tourney -H triple -H anydas`

| big chance | rough odds |
|-------|-------|
| 0/4 | no big pieces |
| 1/4 | 25%-ish |
| 2/4 | sorta 50% |
| 3/4 | close to 75% |
| 4/4 | all big pieces |

Scoring based on piece size:

| lines cleared | normal | big |
|---|----|-----|
| 1 | 40 | 20 |
| 2 | 100 | 50 |
| 3 | 300 | 150 |
| 4 | 1200 | 600 |
| 5 | | 1200 |
| 6 | | 2000 |
| 7 | | 3000 |
| 8 | | 6000 |
