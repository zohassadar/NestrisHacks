## 30 wide with big pieces

this branch only works when built with these flags:

`bash build.sh -H tourney -H triple -H anydas`

| big chance | rough odds |
|-------|-------|
| 0 | 0/16 |
| 1 | 3/16 |
| 2 | 7/16 |
| 3 | 11/16 |
| 4 | 16/16 |

Scoring based on piece size:

| lines cleared | normal | big |
|---|----|-----|
| 1 | 40 | 20 |
| 2 | 100 | 50 |
| 3 | 300 | 150 |
| 4 | 1200 | 600 |
| 5 | | 1200 |
| 6 | | 2000 |
| 7 | | 3000 |
| 8 | | 6000 |
